POSTMORTEM

What went well
+ Tune physics while playing.
+ Tune lights and materials while playing.
+ Primitives easy to see and arrange.

What went poorly
- How can I inspect why the ball is disappearing?
- Specular light reflection from directional light in WebGL.
- Chrome does not show all of the material in WebGL.
- Prevent: Unhandled Exception: System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path "C:\archive\unity\center\Center\Temp\Assembly-CSharp.dll.mdb" is denied.
- Slow build and load time.
- How can I configure more properties in code and less in the editor?
	- How do I instantiate an object purely from code?

- How can I reset the material or light?  On restart it looks dim.
- How do I build a small WebGL download?  It is at least 3 MB for a simple game.
